WHAT IS MY PROJECT:

My project is called UFO drawer and it is a face-paced, 2D, game where the user controls one player. 
The player moves around the screen is has a goal of getting near a destination that randomly 
generates on the screen. Once near, the player will gain points. Every 500 points, new enemies will 
appear on the screen, with old ones disappearing. When the Player finishes with all the levels, the 
game will effectively end.
